## 🧬 Breast Cancer Classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project demonstrates the use of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** for the binary classification of breast cancer tumors as **Malignant** or **Benign**. The goal is to assist early diagnosis by training a predictive model on labeled medical data.
